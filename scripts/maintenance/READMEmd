## ðŸ”§ Cluster Maintenance Script (Memory Optimization)

The [`scale-pods.sh`](scripts/maintenance/scale-pods.sh) script is used to temporarily reduce memory usage on the cluster by scaling down non-essential deployments.

### Usage

```bash
# Scale down selected pods (to reduce memory pressure)
./scripts/maintenance/scale-pods.sh down

# Restore replicas to their original values
./scripts/maintenance/scale-pods.sh up
